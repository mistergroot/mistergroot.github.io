## Welcome to my GitHub

I'm Nick. I am a master's candidate in Ecology, Evolution, and Conservation Biology at Columbia University. I originally applied to Columbia to study anthropogenic change ecology in coral reefs as my thesis project but I've shifted over towards population genetics of corals.
